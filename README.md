# Our Features

## MCHTTP Client

MCHTTP is a api/system made by me (hhoy).

With MCHTTP you can request data, post data and you can make a web browser for it (I will make myself a browser). You can control your world with MCHTTP. MCHTTP is pretty easy to understand.

## MCHTTP Server

MCHTTP Server is the api you use to host MCHTTP servers.

You can make your sites dynamic by controlling the site. MCHTTP Server is pretty similar to Flask (Python web server hosting Library). You use events to control the website stuff just like flask

## DNS

I also have made a DNS system to make browsing easier. You need a dns server for that and its completely optional.

## Client Browser

I made a browser to browse the internet of your world

# Installing

To install dns|server|client you only need one command: `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THEHHOY/MCHTTP-and-DNS/refs/heads/main/installer.lua`
